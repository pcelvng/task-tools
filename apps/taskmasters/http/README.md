# HTTP Taskmaster

http creates a batcher task based on the http request values, query params overwrite json body values, if a body is provided it must be in json format

info - if provided it sends this value as the info value to the bus, if not provided will send the parsed request values in a uri string

simplest usage:

```bash
go build
./http -config=/config.tom
```

### - config variables
- *** config defaults
  - bus        - stdio
  - task_type  - batcher
  - http_port  - 8080


#### â€¼(PLEASE NOTE ~ underscores for json body request, dashes for uri query params)â€¼ ðŸ’£
#### http request variables
- from - the start time of the first task to be created format RFC 3339 YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ (REQUIRED)
- *** pick a duration modifier ***
  - to - the end time of the last task to be created format RFC 3339 YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ (takes presidence over for value)
  - for - the duration that should be run starting at from (ignored if to value is provided)
- task_type     - the task type for the new tasks (REQUIRED)
- every-x-hours - will generate a task every x hours. Includes the first hour. Can be combined with 'on-hours' and 'off-hours' options.
- on-hours      - comma separated list of hours to indicate which hours of a day to back-load during a 24 period (each value must be between 0-23). Order doesn't matter. Duplicates don't matter. Example: '0,4,15' - will only generate tasks on hours 0, 4 and 15
- off-hours     - comma separated list of hours to indicate which hours of a day to NOT create a task (each value must be between 0-23). Order doesn't matter. Duplicates don't matter. If used will trump 'on-hours' values. Example: '2,9,16' - will generate tasks for all hours except 2, 9 and 16.
- topic         - overrides task-type as the default topic
- fragment      - task destination template (may have to build a registry for these)

Examples:
```bash
curl -v -X POST -d '{"task-type":"batcher","every-x-hours":"1","from":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z"}' 'localhost:{http_port}/path/is/ignored/'
curl -v -X GET 'localhost:{http_port}/path/is/ignored/?task-type=example-task&from=2018-05-01T00:00:00Z'
```
