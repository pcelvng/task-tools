# HTTP Taskmaster

HTTP Taskmaster is used to manage tasks from the outside world using http requests. 

Note: query params overwrite json body values, if a body is provided it must be in json format
 
 ## Create a batch task
 - create a batcher task based on the http request values
 
 ``` curl localhost:port/batch?task-type=appName&from=2018-01-01T00&to2018-01-02T00#fragment_data```
 
 
**â€¼(PLEASE NOTE ~ underscores for json body request, dashes for uri query params)â€¼ ðŸ’£** 
### params
- `from` - the start time of the first task to be created format RFC 3339 YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ (REQUIRED)
- **pick a duration modifier**
  - `to` - the end time of the last task to be created format RFC 3339 YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ (takes presidence over for value)
  - `for` - the duration that should be run starting at from (ignored if to value is provided)
- `task-type`     - the task type for the new tasks (REQUIRED)
- `every-x-hours` - will generate a task every x hours. Includes the first hour. Can be combined with 'on-hours' and 'off-hours' options.
- `on-hours`      - comma separated list of hours to indicate which hours of a day to back-load during a 24 period (each value must be between 0-23). Order doesn't matter. Duplicates don't matter. Example: '0,4,15' - will only generate tasks on hours 0, 4 and 15
- `off-hours`     - comma separated list of hours to indicate which hours of a day to NOT create a task (each value must be between 0-23). Order doesn't matter. Duplicates don't matter. If used will trump 'on-hours' values. Example: '2,9,16' - will generate tasks for all hours except 2, 9 and 16.
- `topic`         - overrides task-type as the default topic
- `fragment`      - task destination template (may have to build a registry for these)

## app status 
- get the health status info from a task app

 ``` curl localhost:port/status?app=app_name```
 
### params 
- `app` - name of the app registered with httpmaster 

Examples:
```bash
curl -v -X POST -d '{"task-type":"batcher","every-x-hours":"1","from":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z"}' 'localhost:{http_port}/path/is/ignored/'
curl -v -X GET 'localhost:{http_port}/path/is/ignored/?task-type=example-task&from=2018-05-01T00:00:00Z'
```
